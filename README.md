## 1. How can understanding your audience’s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
How Understanding Your Audience’s Expertise Shapes Communication
Tailoring technical information based on my audience’s expertise level ensures clarity, engagement, and effectiveness. Here’s how:
For Tech Experts (Developers, Engineers, IT Professionals)

•	Provide Code Examples or Diagrams
•	Avoid Oversimplification
For Non-Technical Users (General Consumers, Business Executives, End Users)
•	Use Simple, Relatable Language
•	Focus on Benefits, Not Just Features
•	Use Analogies & Real-World Examples
•	Minimize Jargon Provide Context
Why This Matters
